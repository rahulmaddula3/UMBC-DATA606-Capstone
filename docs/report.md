    "## 2. Background\n",
    "- **What is FlyPrice?**  \n",
    "  FlyPrice leverages machine learning to predict flight ticket prices, helping travelers book cost-effective flights and assisting businesses in understanding pricing trends. Using over 300,000 flight booking records, FlyPrice analyzes factors like airline, departure time, number of stops, and days left to forecast fares in USD. The goal is to make air travel more accessible and economical for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is it Important?**  \n",
    "  Flight prices often fluctuate due to demand, seasonality, and timing, creating uncertainty for travelers. Predictive modeling enables:\n",
    "  - **Travelers:** Helps users save money by optimizing booking decisions.\n",
    "  - **Airlines and Businesses:** Offers insights into customer behavior and allows strategic adjustments to maximize revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Questions:**\n",
    "  1. How can historical flight booking data be used to predict ticket prices?  \n",
    "  2. What are the most important factors influencing flight fares?  \n",
    "  3. How does the combination of airline, departure time, and stops impact price variation?\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Distribution of Ticket Prices\n",
    "The distribution of flight prices is heavily skewed to the right, with most ticket prices concentrated in lower ranges. This skewness indicates that the dataset primarily includes affordable flight fares, but there are also premium-priced tickets.\n",

    "### 2. Airline Distribution\n",
    "The dataset contains flights operated by six airlines. Vistara dominates the market with 42.6% of the share, followed by Air India (27%) and Indigo (14.4%). Airlines like SpiceJet, AirAsia, and GO_FIRST have smaller market shares.\n",
