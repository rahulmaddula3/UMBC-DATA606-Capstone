## **Background**
### **What is it about?**
The **FlyPrice** project aims to predict flight fares based on various factors like route, airline, booking time, and seasonality. By utilizing historical flight price data and machine learning techniques, this project will enable users to make informed decisions on when to book flights for the best prices.

### **Why does it matter?**
Airline ticket prices fluctuate frequently due to dynamic pricing algorithms, making it challenging for travelers to know the best time to book. With accurate price predictions, this system can help customers save money and make more informed travel decisions. Predicting flight prices not only benefits individual travelers but also has applications for travel agencies, airlines, and other stakeholders in the travel industry.

### **Research Questions**
1. How can flight fare prediction models improve customer experience in booking flights?
2. What features (e.g., airline, route, booking date) are the most influential in determining flight prices?
3. Which machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Time Series models) can best capture pricing trends and seasonality in airline fares?
